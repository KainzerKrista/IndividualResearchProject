Hello!
This plugin is a university research project as part of my undergraduate assignment answering the question "Can a dialogue editor become designer friendly in Unity?". With the focus of using a design  framework concluded in my research section of this project, this plugin will hopefully be easier to manage large amounts of branching dialogue nodes. This project allows users to create, edit, and easily manage dialogue nodes. Please note that this project can only run in Unity 2D at the moment. 

Installation instructions:
1) Open a 2D Unity project.
2) Go to "Assets" menu in the Unity Editor tab.
3) Select "Import Package" > "Custom Package".
4) Locate the “DialogueEditor” package file (You can copy the file path from the downloaded folder).
5) Click “Open” to import the package file.
6) Wait for import to complete.
7) You’re all set!!

Troubleshooting:
At this point, the project may be unstable due to on-going errors that may hinder usability. This project will be taken outside of university for further research in the future. Current known errors includes:
- Link drag to create node not working.
- Nodes are not accepting variables.
- Saving graphs not working.
